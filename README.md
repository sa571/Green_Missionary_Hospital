## Methodology
### Data Processing: Utilized SQL to normalize and clean fragmented data from multiple hospital systems—patient admissions, staff attendance, inventory management, and financial records.
### Analytics Engine: Employed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create 25+ calculated measures for KPIs including punctuality rates, capacity utilization, geographic concentration, and revenue variance.
### Visualization: Built interactive Power BI dashboards with real-time monitoring capabilities, geographic mapping, trend analysis, and mobile-responsive design...
## Key Performance Indicators (8-Month Period)
### Revenue21M
### Balance2M
### Admitted218
### Members28 
### Sold50K 
### Rate74.82%

### Critical Findings
### 1. Severe Seasonal Volatility
### Issue: 81% decline in admissions from July (58) to February (11)
### Impact: Revenue swings from 6.6M to 0.0M creating cash flow instability
### Implication: Current staffing and resource model doesn't account for dramatic seasonal patterns

## Geographic Concentration Risk

### Finding: 82.2% of patients from only two locations (Nkwogwu: 46.6%, Umuozo: 35.6%)
### Risk: Heavy dependency on two communities limits growth and creates vulnerability
### Opportunity: Nine other locations combined represent only 17.8% of patient base

## Capacity Constraints at Peak
### July: 14 beds utilized (100% capacity)
### Challenge: Zero buffer for emergencies during peak months
### Contrast: 50% capacity (7 beds) during February shows resource imbalance

4. Medication Concentration
Paracetamol products: 65.64% of all pharmacy sales
Top 3 items: Account for 100% of tracked medication sales
Insight: Pain management and bacterial infections dominate treatment patterns

Operational Strengths
✓ Staff Performance: 74.82% punctuality rate across 28 employees working 3 daily shifts
✓ Financial Health: 21M revenue demonstrates operational viability
✓ Service Consistency: Average 7.92 hours per shift maintained across all periods
